  <h1>Mobile-based Surveillance System</h1>
  
  <p>
      This project is a mobile-based surveillance system developed using React Native. The system is designed to enhance security through the use of mobile cameras and image processing techniques. The project aims to provide real-time surveillance capabilities by capturing images, processing them, and making decisions based on the analysis.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Components</h2>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>React Native:</strong> The framework used for building the mobile application. It allows for cross-platform development, making the app available on both Android and iOS devices.</li>
      <li><strong>Image Processing:</strong> The core functionality of the system involves processing images captured by the mobile device's camera. This includes techniques for detecting objects, identifying intrusions, and triggering alerts.</li>
      <li><strong>Training Module:</strong> The system includes a training module where image data is used to train the model for better accuracy in object detection and recognition.</li>
      <li><strong>UI/UX:</strong> A user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the surveillance system, view captured images, and configure settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Real-time image capture and processing</li>
      <li>Object detection and recognition</li>
      <li>Intrusion detection and alert system</li>
      <li>Configurable settings for surveillance parameters</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Note</h2>
  <p style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">
      This project is incomplete as the camera functionality does not work according to the requirements in React Native. However, the main work of image processing and training has been successfully implemented.
